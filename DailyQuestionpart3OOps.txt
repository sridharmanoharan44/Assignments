1.What is oops stands for?
      => object Oriented programming language.
2.What is Polymorphism? explain types?
      =>It is multiple form of implementation.
      Types:
         1.Method overloading
         2.Method overriding
3.what is interface and example in selenium,java?
       =>It is an abstract type,its specifies the behaviour of the class.
       =>It has umimplemented methods,to overcome multiple inheritance interface used.
       =>can access one or more class methods at the time in one class called interface.
Selenium interface example:
     =>Webelement
4.what is abstarct class and example?
     =>abstract class is an class,which have abstract methods.It partially used for future purpose.
     =>It contains both implemented and unimplemented methods.
Example:
    public void abstract Sum{
          public void add();
           public void sub(){  .....}

5.Difference between multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance
        Multilevel Inheritance:
               =>A class inherits properties from a class which again has inherits properties.
        Multiple Inheritance:
               =>where a class can inherit properties of more than one parent class.
6.Is multiple inheritance possible in java?
         No,multiple inheritance is not possible in java,to overcome this interface is used
7.What is keyword for using inheritance  
          =>Extends is the keyword for using inheritance.
8.what is the keyword to connect interface and class
          =>Implements is the keyword to connect interface and class.
9.what is difference between class and interface
   Class:
          =>class is an Template or blueprints to create object that share common properties and methods.
   Interface:
          =>interface is an blueprint of a class,it has unimplemented methods.
          => to overcome multiple inheritance interface is used.
10.what is difference between class and abstract class
   Abstract class:
           =>abstract class is an class,which have abstract methods.It partially used for future purpose.
           =>It contains both implemented and unimplemented methods.
   class:
            =>class is an Template or blueprints to create object that share common properties and methods.
            =>class has implemented methods.
