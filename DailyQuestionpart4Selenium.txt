1) What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.
    =>It is an open source tool that automates web browsers.
  Components:
   1.Selenium IDE
   2.Selenium WebDriver
   3.Selenium RC
   4.Selenium Grid
  Selenium WebDriver:
     =>Selenium webdriver is framework that permits cross-browers tests.The tool is web based application testing to verify that performs expectedly.
2) How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
    =>JSON wire protocol is a REST API that transfer information between HTTP Servers.Each browser driver has its own Http server.
3.What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?
      =>Id
      =>name
      =>Class
      =>Linked text
      =>Partially linked text
      =>css selector
      =>tagname
      =>xpath
4. Why ID is preferable than X-Path?
      =>ID is the faster technique,because at its root,the call goes to down the document.getElementById which is optimized by most browsers but in xpath
locating complex elements.
5.How to select value in dropdown?
       =>by using selectByValue .
6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?
    Absolute xpath:
            it starts from root node. In future, when project updated to new features the path will get change.so its not preferable to use.
    Relative xpath:
             its start with current node. so, its always preferrable to use.
7) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html
           => by isSelected() method we can check whether checkbox is selected or not.
8)Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager
                  =>setProperty method is used to configure the browser driver path manually.
                  => automates the browser setup in the Selenium code.
9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.
              Preceeding xpath:
                         xpath(current node)://tagname[@attribute='attribute value']preceeding::input[matches index value].
              following xpath:
                         xpath(current node)://tagname[@attribute='attribute value']following::input[matches index value]
10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
         By using getAttribute() method
